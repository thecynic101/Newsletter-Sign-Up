### What I learned

Previously, I would take my time to write out my mark-up before moving on to styling in CSS. However, in this project, i styled my mark-up as I went along and discovered I spent less time on the project.

### Continued development
My main problem was the email validation. I need to build up on my knowledge of regular expressions for inputs and forms in general.
